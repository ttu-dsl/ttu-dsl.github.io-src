Title: Hello World!

Greetings to all! This is the first official post of our brand new website! This
post is simply to detail some of the things we hope to use this website for.

As great as discord is as a means of communication, it's not a useful place to
try to aggregate interesting resources and tools related to this club. So,
perhaps one of the most useful functions for this website will be that we intend
to collect various data science and machine learning related resources (such
as places to get datasets, tutorials, interesting articles, etc.) and post them
to here, on the [resources](resources.html) page. 

In addition, as we start to get projects and such, this website can be a place
to organize information regarding those projects - whether it be to showcase
results, experiments we've tried, or just to keep more formal track of progress.

Finally, this website will be another medium of communication for the club. I
will keep notes regarding meetings and post them here afterwards, so that anyone who
was unable to attend will know what was discussed, and if any links were
mentioned, those will be made generally available here. Additionally, meeting
notices and upcoming events will (eventually) be organized onto the
[schedule](schedule.html) page.
