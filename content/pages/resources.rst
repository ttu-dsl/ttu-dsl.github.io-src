Tools
#####

Python
======

https://www.python.org/

An excellent tool and choice of language when working on ML/DS related projects!
The python community has a library for just about anything you could want - some
of the powerhouses you might run into pretty frequently are `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_,
`SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_, `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, and
`TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_.


Jupyter
=======

https://jupyter.org/ 

Jupyter notebook is a browser-based tool that allows you to mix runnable code
blocks along with nicely formattable markdown, latex, and even widgets for
interacting with your code. This makes for a very good environment for either
exploring or experimenting on the fly with data and algorithms, as well as
cleanly documenting a tutorial or algorithm for demonstration purposes.
