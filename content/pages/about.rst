In the world of today, the respective fields of Data Science and Machine Learning are growing ever more important. It's increasingly critical for people from all walks of life, particularly anyone involved with computer science, to be aware of and have a basic understanding within these fields. Data Science is a concentration within the Computer Science degree program here at Tech, but unfortunately in terms of clubs, it's somewhat underrepresented!

The aim of the Data Science League is to fill that hole - to promote the discussion of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science, to provide opportunities to learn about them, and to apply their knowledge to different interesting projects.
