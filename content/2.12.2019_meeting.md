Title: 2/12/2019 Meeting Notes
Date: 2019-2-13
Category: Notes

Quick recap of what was covered at the meeting yesterday: 

### Club Status

Sadly we're unable to be an officially recognized student organization until we
can go before the student affairs people next September. We'll still be able to
meet in the meantime though, and pizza can be provided through the department.

### Semester Plans

The primary focus I'm hoping to acheive this semester with DSL is on projects.
Doing is a great way of learning, so we'll be trying to compile a list of
projects to form teams around. Our meetings will
hopefully consist of discussion regarding progress on those projects, techniques
people have used, and possibly brief tutorials on things that may be useful in
current or future projects.

There are a few different possible sources for projects. Dr. Gannod has
mentioned potentially connecting us with an athletics team, as well as other
people or departments who may have data they want explored. In addition, we can
play around with kaggle competitions - who knows, maybe someday we can attempt
an ongoing competition and submit!

### ACM Webinar

We watched a brief portion of an ACM seminar by Andrew Ng, covering tips for
going into a machine learning or data science oriented career. If anyone is
interested in watching the entire seminar, it can be found
